## ðŸ“… Day 12â€“20: Mini Project â€“ Drug Side Effect Severity Prediction ðŸš‘âš¡

Worked on a machine learning project to predict drug side effect severity (Mild / Moderate / Severe) using features like dosage, drug class, indications, contraindications, warnings, and expiry date.

Built and compared Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting models

Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, class balancing (SMOTE)

Deployed the best model with FastAPI for real-time predictions
